# 🌟 My SQL Learning Journey

Welcome to my SQL learning repository! This repository contains my SQL learning journey, organized by YouTube playlists. Each folder represents a different channel and includes my code for specific topics I've studied, along with links to the playlists I've followed.

## 📖 Purpose of This Repository
In this repository, I share my personal SQL learning experience, focusing on specific YouTube playlists that I have found helpful and easy to understand. The playlists are curated based on my learning preferences, and I only include code from the particular playlists that I have studied. 

By organizing my learning this way, I aim to create a structured resource that not only helps me track my progress but also serves as a reference for others who are on a similar journey. Each channel's folder contains my code implementations and exercises, making it easier to follow along with the topics covered in the playlists.

## 📜 Disclaimer
The code and concepts shared in this repository are based on the teachings from the respective YouTube playlists. I do not claim ownership of the original content. All credits go to the creators of the playlists.
